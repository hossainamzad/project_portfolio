#My_Portfolio



It's a project built for Udacity Front End Nano Degree course.

## What was used??
    1) HTML5
    2) CSS

## Challenges
    * Replicating the mock-up provided by Udacity. It's not finished,
    and I will revisit it in next few days.
    * Writing CSS is harder than I thought.   
    * Making the site responsive is challenging as well.

## What's Next?
    * I will redo it and try to give it a professional look.
